- [x] Run test suite
- [x] Verify Swagger documentation
- [x] Create testing guide

## Phase 6: System Testing Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create system tests for complete CRUD flow in `__tests__/system.test.js`
- [x] Validate error handling scenarios in system tests

## Testing Guide

### 1. Running Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### 2. Testing Validation
- Tests are located in `__tests__/validation.test.js`
- Tests cover both valid and invalid data scenarios
- Tests ensure proper error messages are returned

### 3. Testing API Routes
- Tests are located in `__tests__/api.test.js`
- Tests cover POST, GET, and DELETE operations
- Tests use mocked MongoDB and Mongoose for isolation

### 4. System Testing
- Tests are located in `__tests__/system.test.js`
- Tests cover the complete CRUD flow for topics
- Tests validate error handling scenarios

### 5. Accessing Swagger Documentation
1. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Access Swagger documentation at:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/docs
```

### 6. Manual API Testing
Use tools like Postman, curl, or the frontend to test:
- POST /api/topics - Create student records
- GET /api/topics - Get all students
- DELETE /api/topics?id={id} - Delete a student
- PUT /api/topics/[id] - Update a student

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Project analysis and planning
- [x] All implementation phases completed
- [x] Testing guide created
